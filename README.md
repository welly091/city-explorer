## Overview
This project demonstrates how to fetch APIs from a website by using axios.

## Getting Started
1. Get a API key from LocationIQ.com.
2. Create a React App and install axios(npm install axios).
3. Store API key in .env and name it "REACT_APP_LOCATION_API" and the '.env' in .gitignore so the API key won't be uploaded to github.
4. Set up a component called "Explorer" and create Form element. Render to App component.
5. Create a function that uses 'axios' to fetch data from LocationIQ.com when the Form submmit. Remember to add .then() and .catch().
6. Style HTML component by using React-bootstrap.
